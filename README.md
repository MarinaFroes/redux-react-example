# Redux + React Tutorial

## Motivation

- My motivation was to learn how to use Redux to manage the React states.
- I followed the Traversy Media tutorial "Redux Crash Course With React".

## Installation and Use

- Download the files, cd into root directory and run:
```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```
